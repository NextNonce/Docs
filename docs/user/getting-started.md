# Getting Started: Your Account

Your NextNonce account saves your added wallets, allowing you to sign in on any device and see your complete, synchronized portfolio.

This guide will walk you through the different ways to create an account or sign in on both Android and iOS.

## On Android

Follow these instructions to get started with your account on an Android device.

### With Email and Password

**Phase 1: Open the App**

The first screen you'll see when you open the app allows you to either sign up or sign in. The app respects your device's light or dark theme.

</div>

**Phase 2: Enter Your Credentials**

Tap on the **Email** and **Password** fields to enter your details.

* **For a new account:** Enter the email address you want to use and create a strong, secure password.
* **For an existing account:** Enter the email and password you used when you first signed up.

</div>

**Phase 3: Choose Your Action**

After entering your credentials, tap the appropriate button:

* **`Sign Up`**: Tap this to create your new account.
* **`Sign In`**: Tap this if you already have an account.

### With Google Account

For a faster experience, you can use your existing Google account.

**Phase 1: Start the Google Sign-In**

From the main authentication screen, tap the **`Continue with Google`** button.

**Phase 2: Choose a Google Account**

A dialog will appear showing the Google accounts currently signed into your device.

* Tap on the account you wish to use with NextNonce.
* If your desired account isn't listed, tap **`Add another account`** and follow the prompts to sign in to it.

</div>


**Phase 3: Grant Permission**

After selecting an account, a final confirmation screen from Google will appear. This is a standard security step that allows Google to securely sign you into the NextNonce app.

* Review the information that will be shared (your name, email address, and profile picture).
* Tap **`Agree and share`** to complete the process and create your account or sign in.

</div>


You will now be logged into the NextNonce app.

## On iOS

Getting started on an iPhone or iPad is just as simple. The user interface is designed to feel right at home on iOS. Currently, authentication on iOS is handled via Email and Password.

**Phase 1: Open the App**

When you first launch NextNonce, you'll be greeted by the main authentication screen. It fully supports both the light and dark modes of your device.

  <img src="/images/ui/auth/ios_auth_init_dark.png"  alt="iOS Dark">
</div>

**Phase 2: Enter Your Credentials**

Tap the **Email** and **Password** fields to type in your information.

  <img src="/images/ui/auth/ios_auth_email_dark.png"  alt="iOS Dark">
</div>


**Phase 3: Choose Your Action**

Once your details are entered, tap the button for the action you want to take:

* **`Sign Up`**: To create a brand new NextNonce account.
* **`Sign In`**: To log into an existing account that you may have created on an iOS or Android device.

> **One Account, All Platforms**
> Remember, once your account is created, you use the **exact same login method** to sign in on another device (iOS or Android) to see your synchronized data.
